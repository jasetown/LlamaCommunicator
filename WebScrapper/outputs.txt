Comment 1: Item arrived quickly.  In very nice shape cosmetically.  All set up and working fine.  Battery charge capacity 100%.
Comment 2: Very good quality item for good price!!!
Comment 3: A++ supplier, phone in like new condition. Great transaction. 
Comment 4: Phone shipped out fast was in good condition like mentioned in the description my only issue was the price I purcahsed the phone 1 day and the very next day the phone price had dropped about $80 I reached out to the seller but couldn't come to a solution that bestvsuited me, but overall the seller was quick in their response so I'll give them a plus in that department I'd purchase again as well.
Comment 5: The phone works well and looks as good as described. Shipping was fast and arrived by predicted date. Overall the purchase was a pleasant experience. I don't know what else needs to be said. I didn't communicate with the buyer because there was no need to.  Phone was packaged well for shipping. This is starting to feel like homework just to leave a positive feedback why must I reach 500 characters? eBay do better.
Comment 6: Product arrived quickly and well packaged. Exactly as described, working perfectly. Great communication with the seller and excellent service. Highly recommend!

Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB Unlocked Smartphone -Excellent
Comment 1: Used this seller before. Very happy with the purchase. Phone is almost a 10 some minor minor scratches. One area on the screen and after I put a glass protector on it looks perfect. Phone reports repair of camera and display. Says reported to apple with genuine Apple components. Pricing was reasonable and seems to function flawlessly. Battery capacity shows 90%. Super fast shipping. The 13 pro max is maybe the best model ever produced if you research it. One thing I like is physical sim and esim
Comment 2: Dont hesistate to buy this product, Iphone 13 pm came in excellent condition with one tiny insignificant chip on top of phone which i only noticed underneath direct light at a certain angle (which doesn't matter because of using a case) Battery health was at an excellent 96%. IMEI checks out and overall im very satisfied as this was my first refurbished Iphone purchased on ebay and not through apples overpriced program. Thank you to the seller. 
Comment 3: Absolutely flawless device. Battery health is at 100% and I've checked over and over and there is not a single scratch, or even a sign of ever being used. I feel like this is literally a brand-new phone. Shipping was fast and overall, a great product!
Comment 4: Received promptly, carefully packaged. Pristine condition, looks almost like new! Love the purple! Battery life acceptable with description. Seamless set up with my carrier. Have used for past month without any problems. Very pleased! Came with charging cord as described. Recommend seller! 
Comment 5: I never received the iPhone still now and the packed is marked untracked. I contacted the seller and he or she responded to my messages only twice and ignored me. I recently opened a refund claim with ebay. I think this seller is not trustworthy. 
Comment 6: Ordered phone but returned due to battery health being 82% when advertised minimum of 85%. Replacement phone came with 84%. Decided to keep it. Overall good seller with great communication. Phone is near mint condition
